Developed in Godot Engine v3.1.1

Player 1 uses the up and down arrow keys, and player 2 uses W and S keys to move up their paddles up and down.

The resolution is not proper for a mobile device like iOS or Android, but works fine for web and desktop. This can be adjusted to fit a more proper mobile resolution.
